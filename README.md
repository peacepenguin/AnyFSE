The AnyFSE Home application aims to give users the ability to use their favorite launchers as Home applications for Gaming Full Screen Experience mode on modern Windows.

[Latest Release](https://github.com/ashpynov/AnyFSE/releases/latest)

[Help and Discussions](https://discord.gg/hnVwuTzDmk)

AnyFSE can be selected as Home application for full screen experience and will execute users favourite launchers like Playnite, Steam Big Picture mode, LaunchBox, etc. in full screen experience mode (Xbox mode).

Some other launchers potentially can be supported too with minor customizations

## Kudos

- Way how to create home app was inspired by @driver1998 work [FullScreenExperienceShell](https://github.com/driver1998/FullScreenExperienceShell). Also thanks to discord user 'silicon' who show me that project.
- Handling of ASUS Rog Ally buttons inspired by such projects like [Handheld Companion](https://github.com/Valkirie/HandheldCompanion) and [g-helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper).
- Desktop Xbox startup (Home app selection without a handheld) is adapted from @victorrjimenezz work [XboxStartupEnabler](https://github.com/victorrjimenezz/XboxStartupEnabler) (MIT).
- Discord users 'Marecki' and 'TwoTracks' who helped me to design and test such features like Xbox Ally support and Steam buttons mapping.
- All users submitted me Localization files.

## Defender flagging

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft Defender may occasionally flag AnyFSE with a `Trojan.Wacatac!ml` detection. I believe these are false positives caused by behavior considered suspicious, such as the process enumeration during launcher start and DLL injection used for ASUS button remapping. See [ACSE Filter and antivirus detection](#acse-filter-and-antivirus-detection) for details.

> **AnyFSE does not collect or share any information (personal or not) or send any telemetry.**
>
> **But don't take my word for it.** If you have any doubts, don't run the prebuilt binaries. The source code is available for you to review, and you can [build it yourself](build.md).

## How it is works

If AnyFSE is selected as home application:

1. Windows starts AnyFSE as fullscreen home application (Fullscreen experience or Xbox mode).
2. AnyFSE read configuration and start launcher selected by user.
3. Show splash screen (text or video).
4. Wait till launcher executed (try to detect it main window).
5. Close splash screen and exit

Same for cases when AnyFSE executed from gamebar.

In case if ASUS ROG Ally buttons remaping is configured it will start second instance as background app that listen such buttons and execute handlers on keypress.

The `AnyFSE Listener` scheduled task owns background HID/hotkey listener startup.
It runs the listener directly, elevated in the installing user's interactive session,
at logon and on demand from the app or settings. Task Scheduler ignores duplicate
start requests while that task is running. No registry Run entry is created;
legacy `AnyFSE Hotkeys` Run entries are removed during installation and app startup.
The listener exits when neither button remapping nor hotkeys is enabled. Its mutex
remains a fallback for manual invocations and older binaries during upgrades.

## ASUS ROG Ally buttons

On ASUS ROG Ally devices AnyFSE can redefine the dedicated system buttons:

- Armoury Crate
- Command Center / Library

Each button can be assigned to a custom action. AnyFSE also supports combinations with the Mode button, the usual back paddle on ROG Ally devices, so the same physical buttons can have an additional `Mode + button` action.

Armoury Crate SE and the ASUS Optimization service normally receive these button events too. If both AnyFSE and ASUS software handle the same input, the native ASUS action can still be triggered. To avoid this, either uninstall Armoury Crate SE or let AnyFSE filter these inputs before ASUS Optimization handles them.

For this purpose AnyFSE includes the `AnyFSE ACSE Filter Injector` service. The service monitors the ASUS Optimization process and injects a small filter into the device-read path used by that process. The filter only targets the ASUS-specific button reports required for Armoury Crate, Command Center, and Library buttons handling. Other input processing is left untouched.

This component is not in the critical path for normal input, launcher startup, or Full Screen Experience operation. It is enabled only when ASUS ROG Ally button remapping is enabled, and it is designed to make the smallest practical change: suppress the conflicting ASUS button events while allowing the rest of the system and device input stack to continue normally.

### ACSE Filter and antivirus detection

- ACSE Filter prevents ASUS Optimization from handling selected ROG Ally buttons when AnyFSE remaps them. It monitors `AsusOptimization.exe` and injects `AnyFSE.ACSEFilterHook.dll` into that process.

- Injection uses the traditional `VirtualAllocEx` → `WriteProcessMemory` → `CreateRemoteThread` → `LoadLibraryW` technique. This is legitimate DLL injection, but the same API sequence is widely used by malware and is the most likely reason for an antivirus alert.

- For the short injection window, it enables `SeDebugPrivilege` and opens the target with process-memory and remote-thread permissions. These are strong behavioral indicators for antivirus products even though the privilege is disabled immediately afterward.

- The injector is installed as an automatically started Windows service, watches for ASUS Optimization restarts, and reinjects the DLL when necessary. Service persistence combined with process monitoring and injection can appear suspicious to Defender.

- What is filtered: The hook examines only six-byte HID reports from ASUS devices with vendor ID 0x0B05 and the configured product IDs. It replaces only the configured Armoury Crate, Command Center, and Library button reports with an empty report. Other reads are passed through unchanged

- In the ACSE Filter source, there is no networking, downloading, credential access, keylogging, file encryption, Defender disabling, or arbitrary payload execution. The DLL path is fixed to AnyFSE.ACSEFilterHook.dll beside the injector executable.

Also AnyFSE Installer itself does trick to install AnyFSE package to be registered as Home Application. This also may flag Defender:

- It contain bundled archive (or download it).

- It exract this archive to Program Files

- It Enable developer mode to allow CustomCapability 'Microsoft.appCategory.gamingHome'

- It install temp certificate to Trusted People to install package

- After installation it remove temp certificate and turn off developer mode.


## Install, Configure and Uninstall

> [!NOTE]
> AnyFSE can now enable FSE mode (Home app selection and Xbox mode at sign-in) on desktops and other non-handheld PCs.
> Supported handhelds like the ASUS ROG Ally need nothing extra. On other PCs the installer offers to patch the Windows
> components that hide this mode, and you can enable it later from AnyFSE settings. A restart is required after patching.
> See [Desktop Xbox startup](#desktop-xbox-startup).

### How to install

Launch `AnyFSE.Installer.exe`, wait for it to finish, then configure AnyFSE from the Start menu entry.

Your launcher should be installed additionally.

Please note: that AnyFSE work only when it is selected as home application in Settings->Gaming->Full screen experience.


### How to launch and configure

In start menu find AnyFSE application. Press right mouse key and choose 'Configure' task.

### Cleanup if uninstall was broken

If uninstall failed or left files behind, clean up the remaining pieces manually.
Run these commands from an elevated Command Prompt.

Remove the identity package:

```cmd
powershell -Command "Get-AppxPackage *AnyFSE* | Remove-AppxPackage"
```

Remove the ACSE Filter injector service:

```cmd
sc stop ACSEFilterInjector
sc delete ACSEFilterInjector
```

Delete the installation folder:

```cmd
rmdir /s /q "%ProgramFiles%\AnyFSE"
```

Remove the uninstall registration from the registry:

```cmd
reg delete "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\AnyFSE" /f
```


## Splash Videos
AnyFSE may show shuffled video as splash during your launcher is loading.

To do this, Create folder 'splash' in data folder (c:\ProgramData\AnyFSE) and put there you favourite mp4 or webm videos. Files will be shuffled each time splash screen is shown.

For sure it will be good idea to suppress native splash screens of launchers, to do so enable custom settings and add startup argument to prevent native splash (for Playnite it is ```--hidesplashscreen``` option).


### Filename control
You can specify custom position of loop via filename. To do this - name should contain additional part before extension like:

```splash.m4000.mp4``` or ```other_splash.5000.webm``` here is ***m4000*** and ***5000*** instructions to
- 'm' or 'M' - mute video during loop
- '4000' and '5000' position in milliseconds from start of video to rewind to during loop.


## Desktop Xbox startup

AnyFSE builds on [XboxStartupEnabler](https://github.com/victorrjimenezz/XboxStartupEnabler) to enable Home app
selection and Xbox mode at sign-in **without spoofing your PC's device form factor** in the registry. Spoofing tells
every Windows component the PC is a handheld, which can affect power profiles and thermal limits; AnyFSE instead patches
only the handheld checks in `gamemode.dll`, `SettingsHandlers_Gaming.dll`, `twinui.pcshell.dll` and, on newer builds,
`SettingsEnvironment.Desktop.dll`.

- **Enable:** accept the offer during install, or use **Enable Xbox startup on PC** in AnyFSE settings, then restart.
- **Restore:** use **Restore originals** in AnyFSE settings. Uninstalling also restores them and offers a restart.
- **Survives Windows updates:** AnyFSE settings always show the current state. If Windows Update or `sfc` replaces the
  files, you can re-enable from settings.

Beyond the upstream patcher, AnyFSE can handle **unverified DLLs**, meaning Windows builds whose code layout hasn't been
validated yet:

- It finds handheld checks by following the Windows device-form API (`RtlGetDeviceFamilyInfoEnum`) to where its result
  is compared, rather than matching one fixed byte pattern, so moved or recompiled checks are still found.
- It can stub gaming exports with unfamiliar prologues when that is structurally safe.
- Sites found this way are never applied automatically. AnyFSE settings list exactly what would change and apply them
  only after you confirm.
- `AnyFSE.exe /XboxStartup status`, `scan` and `apply-unverified` support diagnostics.

Every change is backed up and verified before any system file is replaced. See
[desktop Xbox startup](docs/desktop-xbox-startup.md) for the full design.
